# Enhanced File Section Implementation

## Overview
A new enhanced file upload section has been implemented for **new projects only** (created after January 1, 2025). Old projects will continue to use the existing file section without any disruption.

## Features

### 1. **Beautiful Modal Upload Interface**
- Click "Upload Files" button to open a modern, eye-catching modal
- Gradient purple theme with smooth animations
- Two input fields:
  - **Header Text**: Required text field for file description
  - **File Upload**: Required file input (max 50MB)

### 2. **Save Options**
- **Save**: Saves the file and closes the modal
- **Save & Add More**: Saves the file, refreshes the form, keeps modal open for multiple uploads
- **Cancel**: Closes modal without saving

### 3. **Modern Grid Display**
- Files displayed in a responsive grid layout (auto-fills based on screen width)
- Each file card shows:
  - Header text at the top
  - Filename at the bottom with file icon
  - Delete icon (for authorized users)
- Beautiful gradient cards with hover effects
- Cards transform and elevate on hover

### 4. **Responsive Design**
- Grid automatically adjusts: minimum 280px per card
- Horizontal layout that wraps to next row when space runs out
- Mobile-friendly and tablet-optimized

## Files Created

### 1. **Livewire Component**
- `app/Livewire/Project/EnhancedFilesSection.php`
  - Handles file upload with header text
  - Modal state management
  - Save and Save & Add More functionality
  - File deletion with confirmation

### 2. **Blade View**
- `resources/views/livewire/project/enhanced-files-section.blade.php`
  - Beautiful gradient UI design
  - Modal with form inputs
  - Grid layout for file display
  - Smooth animations and transitions

### 3. **Database Migration**
- `database/migrations/2025_10_29_215449_add_header_text_to_project_files_table.php`
  - Adds `header_text` column to `project_files` table
  - Nullable string field

## Implementation Logic

### Conditional Rendering
In `resources/views/projects/show.blade.php`:

```php
@php
    // Use enhanced file section for projects created after Jan 1, 2025
    $useEnhancedFiles = $project->created_at >= '2025-01-01';
@endphp

@if($useEnhancedFiles)
    @livewire('project.enhanced-files-section', [...])
@else
    @livewire('project.files-section', [...])
@endif
```

### Key Points
- **Old projects** (before 2025-01-01): Use original `FilesSection` component
- **New projects** (after 2025-01-01): Use new `EnhancedFilesSection` component
- No changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatible

## Database Schema

### project_files table
```sql
- id
- project_id
- task_id
- department_id
- filename
- header_text (NEW - nullable)
- created_at
- updated_at
- deleted_at
```

## Permissions
- Upload: Requires 'Files Section' permission
- Delete: Requires 'File Delete' permission
- Same permission structure as original component

## UI/UX Highlights

### Color Scheme
- Primary gradient: Purple (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Hover effects with elevation
- Smooth transitions (0.3s ease)

### Animations
- Card hover: translateY(-5px) with enhanced shadow
- Button hover: translateY(-2px) with glow effect
- Delete icon: scale(1.1) on hover

### Typography
- Header: 1.1rem, font-weight 600
- Filename: 0.9rem with icon
- Clean, modern font rendering
